Hello, my name is **Francisco** and I live in Goiania.

I have experience in Java, Python, Android, Iot, MachineLearning, BigData, C#, Angular.

Now I work at Startup CampoGestao where I design and developing software techologies to brasilian agribusiness. In this work I use Java with springboot, postgres as relational database and mongodb as not relational database. I use message service like a RabbitMq too.
At this moment I have worked in two projects that makes me proud. First is a Enterprise Resource Planing for soy and corn farmers. In this project I have integrations with Internet of Things devices and I use machine learning and pattern recognition to offer to users some recomendations of prices and suplies for work them.
Second I designed and developed one integration with NASA satellite data where I use some machine learning techniques to identify cropland, florest or ox pasture. The objective is know the soy and corn planting area to increase my algorithm that predicts its prices. 
I University professor too where I lecture software development with some techologies that I use dayly.

I have continous integration and coontinous delivery techniques too. In this case I use jenkins and I have some experience with docker too.

I love to learn new techologies and discovery the best fit of its application.

For example. In some cases, machine learning is best than statistic in other, not...
In some cases, microservices is best than scheduled cron scripts but in other, not...

My lemma is: it's not because you have a hammer that every screw is a nail. you have to find the best fit between techology and problem.

### My Projects

I have projects that I commited into GitHub and <a href="https://gitlab.com/chicocx/"><img alt="Francisco CalaÃ§a GitLab" width="22px" src="images/logo/gitlab.png" />GitLab</a>. You can access this projects in their respective environments.

I really enjoy sharing knowledge. So, if you want any example and it is within my reach, you can contact me.

### My YouTube Chanel

I have a <a href="http://youtube.com/proffranciscocalaca"> <img alt="Francisco CalaÃ§a Youtube" width="22px" src="images/logo/youtube.png" /> YouTube Chanel </a> too.
